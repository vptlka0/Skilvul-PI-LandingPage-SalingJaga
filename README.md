## Project Explanation

SalingJaga is a digital initiative aimed at protecting women and children from violence in Indonesia. 🛡️👩‍👧‍👦 The landing page introduces the SalingJaga app, which enables users to quickly request help in emergency situations. By leveraging real-time location technology, the app connects those in need with nearby women who can provide immediate assistance within a 1-2 km radius. 📱📍

The project highlights:

- 🚨 The alarming number of violence cases against women in Indonesia and the lack of adequate response from authorities.
- 🤝 SalingJaga's mission to foster a supportive community where women help each other stay safe.
- 🆘 Key features such as emergency help requests, real-time notifications, navigation to those in need, and the ability to record incident chronology for legal purposes.
- 💬 Community testimonials and articles on gender equality, mental health, and career development, reinforcing the platform's commitment to empowerment and safety.

SalingJaga is more than just an app—it's a movement to create a safer environment for women and children, supported by technology and community solidarity. 🌟
